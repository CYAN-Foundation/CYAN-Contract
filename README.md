# CYAN Contract Solidity Source
The solidity source for the CYAN contract

CYAN.sol contains the constructor and is a good starting point for analyzing the source.

Context.sol, ERC20.sol, IERC20.sol, and IERC20Metadata.sol are all borrowed from the OpenZeppelin ERC20 contracts: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/tree/master/contracts/token/ERC20

Address of the official deployed CYAN contract:
